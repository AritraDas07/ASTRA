## 📖 Overview

**ASTRA (Autonomous Service & Transaction Routing Agent)** is a decentralized, agentic workflow engine built on the **Weilliptic Icarus** ecosystem. It bridges the critical "trust gap" in the AI economy by automating the verification and settlement of digital work.

Current automation tools (Zapier, Make) operate as opaque "black boxes"—when a payment is triggered, there is no immutable proof of *why* or *if* the conditions were truly met. ASTRA solves this by acting as a transparent, on-chain adjudicator. It orchestrates complex, multi-step workflows that verify external events (e.g., GitHub PR merges, Jira tickets, IoT sensor data) and executes financial transactions only when strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) policies are cryptographically proven.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Trustless Verification:** Connects to external "source of truth" APIs (GitHub, Linear, Slack) to verify work completion in real-time.
* **On-Chain Auditability:** Every decision—whether to approve or deny a payout—is hashed and recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail for policy enforcement.
* **Natural Language Control:** Powered by **Icarus LLM**, allowing users to define complex logic in plain English (e.g., *"Pay 500 USDC if the 'Release' branch passes CI/CD"*).
* **Resilient Workflows:** Built with **Weil-SDK**, featuring built-in error recovery, conditional branching, and "Human-in-the-Loop" escalation for ambiguous cases.
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration:** Detailed context injection to prevent AI hallucinations and ensure accurate data interpretation.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The ASTRA architecture consists of three core layers:

1.  **Input Layer (Icarus Engine):**
    * Captures user intent via Natural Language.
    * Parses context using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
2.  **Orchestration Layer (Weil-SDK):**
    * **Fetcher Nodes:** Retrieve data from external APIs (GitHub, Jira).
    * **Logic Core:** Executes conditional branching (`IF status == 'success'`).
    * **Executor Nodes:** Trigger payments or notifications.
3.  **Settlement & Trust Layer:**
    * **Smart Contracts:** Store decision hashes on-chain (Polygon/Base).
    * **Icarus Dashboard:** Visualizes the live workflow state.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Agent Framework:** Weilliptic `weil-sdk` (Node.js)
* **AI/LLM:** Weilliptic Icarus Engine (MCP support)
* **Blockchain:** [Polygon / Ethereum Sepolia / Base] (for Audit Logs)
* **Integrations:**
    * **DevOps:** GitHub API, GitLab
    * **Communication:** Slack Webhooks, Discord
    * **Payments:** ERC-20 Smart Contracts, Stripe Wrapper

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* Node.js v18+
* Weilliptic SDK API Key
* Wallet Private Key (for testnet transactions)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/astra-agent.git](https://github.com/yourusername/astra-agent.git)
cd astra-agent

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install

```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
WEILLIPTIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url

```

---

## 🏃 Usage / Demo

### Step 1: Initialize the Agent

Start the local Weil-SDK runtime:

```bash
npm run start:agent

```

### Step 2: Trigger a Workflow

You can trigger the workflow via the CLI or the Icarus Dashboard.

**Example Command:**

> "Monitor the repository `astra-core` for PR #42. If the CI checks pass, release the milestone payment of 0.5 ETH to the contributor."

### Step 3: View Execution

1. Open the **Icarus Dashboard**.
2. Watch the agent verify the GitHub status in real-time.
3. Observe the conditional logic branch to "Approved."
4. Click the **Transaction Hash** link to verify the audit log on Etherscan.

## 🧩 How It Works (Code Snippet)

Here is a simplified view of the Weil-SDK logic used in ASTRA:

```javascript
import { Workflow, Step } from '@weilliptic/weil-sdk';

const auditWorkflow = new Workflow('GitHub_Payment_Audit');

// Step 1: Fetch Context
auditWorkflow.addStep('verify_pr', async (ctx) => {
    const prStatus = await github.getPRStatus(ctx.repo, ctx.prId);
    return { passed: prStatus.checks === 'success' };
});

// Step 2: Conditional Logic
auditWorkflow.addStep('adjudicate', async (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.steps.verify_pr.passed) {
        await blockchain.writeAuditLog('APPROVED', ctx.prId);
        return 'PAYMENT_RELEASED';
    } else {
        await blockchain.writeAuditLog('DENIED', ctx.prId);
        throw new Error('SLA Verification Failed');
    }
});

```
